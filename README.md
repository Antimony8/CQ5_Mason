# Mars Exploration Time and space complexity

# Time complexity
the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s. This is beacuse the time it takes to complete is linear with the size of the input.

# Space complexity
 the space complexity of the program is O(1). This is because the space complexity of the variables is constant (O(1)) since their size does not depend on the input size. And space complexity does not depend on the length of the input.
